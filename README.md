# CS340-Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? 
How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Creating maintanable, readable, and adpatable code starts during the project planning process. Poor project designs lead to code that becomes difficult to support and scale.
Additionally, proper coding practices such as using in line comments and proper descriptive variable names help increase code readability and long term supportability.
Object oriented programming techniques such as modular reusable code will ensure that the code can be adaptable and easily supportable in the future. Developing the CRUD
python code was a good example of this, as each function was very specific to a certain task (such as creating a record). This let me use my dashboard app to call these
specific functions and manipulate them into highly customizable dashboards. The benefit of coding this way is that we could connect to multiple dashboards or other 
code extensions, and we could utilize our CRUD code to support all extensions.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases 
to meet other client requests?

I used my computer science approach during this project to understand the requirements, build a design, implement and iterate, and deploy a solution that met the
client's needs. I read through the client documentationt to understand and build their listing of requirements. As I was designing and implementing the code, I went back
to these requirements often to ensure that I was hitting all of their requirements. I also tested frequently through my implementation of the code. Lastly,
since I was new to mongoDB, I would frequently run commands in the console when testing my code, to make sure I was getting the same results. I would employ these 
techniques with other types of data

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists provide a necessary skill in today's world with their understanding of technologies and process. They can take a complex problem and break it 
int several components, such as a web dashboard and database. Computer scientists and software engineers use specific approaches to ensure requirements are translated
into features. My work as a computer scientist can help a company by leveraging frameworks such as MVC, and my knowledge of the different technology suites to build
solutions that will meet their needs.
